# rethinkscape-gtk3
A Inkscape UI mockup proposal based on [gnome GTK3 interface design team repos](https://wiki.gnome.org/Design)

![](https://github.com/Xaviju/rethinkscape-gtk3/blob/master/current/gkt3-inkscape.png?raw=true)

## Why
 Inkscape is a powerful tool. Born in 2003 and developed actively since then, it probably never had an actual UX and design work behind and lots of features have been added in every version of the software. Most of its features have been added piece-meal over the years with out much thought about consistency.

 To many designer non Inkscape users it seems to be unstable, not proffesional, inmature and with a lack of features. The reason: its usability and design.

## Why GTK3
Inkscape [is moving fast towards GTK3](http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/GTK%2B_3_migration#Current_status) and it not only provides a lot of advantages for developers. It is also an amazing opportunity fot interface design. Gnome has done a pretty amazing job with its design and Inkscape could take advantage on it to create not only a powerful tool but also a besutiful, usable interface.

### How to contribute
If this project gains enough interest, we could create a repository of small open source design interface fixes and proposals based on the Gnome design principles to share with the [inkscape developers](https://gitlab.com/inkscape/inkscape). We could even create [glade](https://glade.gnome.org/) files to help with implementation.
